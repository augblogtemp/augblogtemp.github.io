It seems like stock for VIVE is not enough for demands so had to wait for few weeks after the order was completed. Interesting thing about the item was it came from China not from US. HTC VIVE Postage Box As I open the box, there was black box with smooth surface covered in plastic bag. On the side, there was a Styrofoam to hold the box and prevent the external force to damage the item. Box showing Steam VR Logo and HTC VIVE with image of actual VR. Inside the box This picture is showing how it looks inside as I open the box. On the left-top, there is Get Started manual. Below the manual there was VIVE controller placed in sponge. On the right there was HTC VIVE covered in plastic bag. Overview of ManualImage on top is a manual of how to use VR. This image is close up view on list of parts on the manual. There are A-N items, which are label for each component. This label is has a tag below in text with different languages. A. Base station x 2B. Sync cable (optional)C. Base station power adapter x 2D.
