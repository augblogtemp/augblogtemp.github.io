# About HTC Vive (Steam VR):

{% blockquote Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive HTC VIVE%}
HTC Vive is a virtual reality headset developed by HTC and Valve Corporation, released on 5 April 2016. This headset is designed to utilize "room scale" technology to turn a room into 3D space via sensors, with the virtual world allowing the user to navigate naturally, with the ability to walk around and use motion tracked handheld controllers to vividly manipulate objects, interact with precision, communicate and experience immersive environments

I have ordered HTC VIVE in Australia, where it is not available yet locally. It seems like stock for VIVE is not enough for demands so had to wait for few weeks after the order was completed. Interesting thing about the item was it came from China not from US.
